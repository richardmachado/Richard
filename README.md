After doing many different customer service, debt collection, and tech support job, I found myself searching for a better carreer path. I had always been interested in computers and software ever since I was a child growing up with an original Apple IIGS. I would write small snippets of code on it in DOS, but never pursued it further. I thought i needed a University Degree in Computer Science to accomplish anything.

Lambda School has taught many great skills which I am ready to implement to any project large or small.

Skills: Javascript, React, React Native, Redux, Python, Node.js, Testing, PostgreSQL

* I am currently seeking active employment
